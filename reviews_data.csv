Eiskatze,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2019","I love the LED's on it, it's so neat having a rainbow effect glowing over my desktop. I don't actually put my headphones on it as the only spot to put it is way too close to my monitor. I do, however, use it to hang a very dear necklace, and the little gems on it catch and reflect the light in a dazzling display! So there you go, don't use it for headphones but jewelry! ... Okay, maybe this really isn't for that. I did try my headphones on it though, some Microsoft lifechat(?) thing, heavier than I'd like. They worked great on it, didn't really bend, etc. Honestly my only complaint is how freaking difficult it was to get the posts into the USB hub-thing. Took me a good 10 minutes of trying and re-trying, very tight fit. On the plus, it's that fit that makes them not instantly fall out from headphones or shiny jewelry.

The USB ports work very well, I've had zero issues with any of them. I like to use it to charge my 3DS while I play it, as my main charging area for it isn't really close enough to charge & play. I feel like this is a worthy buy if you need something fancy to light up your area."

Sandra G.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2019","I originally bought a rgb stand for more money than this one and was extremely disappointed. So when I got this one the other day I was ecstatic to have gotten exactly what I wanted. It is just as described. The lighting looks very nice and is soothing to watch. I wish the stand was a bit taller for large headsets, but it still works just fine. I charge my phone from one of the usb ports and am able to organize all my wires much better now. If you are looking for an aesthetically pleasing headphone stand, I absolutely recommend this one. I appreciate when sellers describe a product as exactly what it is; Nothing more and nothing less. And the seller did just that. Thank you!!"
Timothy A. Taylor,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022",I recently purchased a good set of gaming headphones and needed something to put them on that made them look as cool when I wasn't wearing them. This stand is perfect for them. I've actually had people ask me where I got this (I sent them link and told them to enjoy).
Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2021","Not great quality. The headphones will cause it to lean/bend, but that is expected. My main issues is that it doesn't return to original shape. Also it has no off switch and the chosen color choice resets when unplugged. So that combination is rather annoying."
Amra,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019","I love Enhance products and own more than a few,this stand was my latest addition,and like all their stuff,it matches perfectly.Yes w/bigger cans the acrylic support rods flex a bit,but it holds fine and is very stabil,I have a bigger set of Sennheiser gamers on mine and it does fine.The clear supports look very nice on every color or using the rainbow setting.If you're into RGB or things that glow and are colorful this stand is for you.As for a hub,it is fairly useful but as it is only 2.0 it isnt to good for data transfer,but to me it really doesnt matter,I knew what it was before i bought it and it is everything i expected."
pietro,"Reviewed in Italy on December 28, 2022","Il supporto cuffie con luci led è molto bello quando acceso al buio. Le prese usb sono molto comode.
Poteva essere un prodotto ottimo se avesse avuto le porte usb3 e se fosse un poco più solido. Le aste che si incastrano nella base e che fanno da supporto alle cuffie sono molto molto leggere e delicate. Prezzo secondo me troppo alto, ma altri prodotti simili costano anche di più.. ."
OLIVIER DETRY,"Reviewed in France on December 26, 2020","J'aime les ports USB (pour charger le casque, alimenter le tapis souris RGB, brancher/charger la souris, etc...)
La colonne plie légèrement avec le poids de mon casque (Steelseries Actis 7), mais rien de grave.
Point positif : mémorise la couleur choisir quand on le rallume, ce qui évite de devoir la re-sélectionner."
